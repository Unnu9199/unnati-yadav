    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <p>
    <p>HISTORY is narratives. From chaos comes order. We seek to understand the past by determining and ordering
        ‘facts’; and from these narratives we hope to explain the decisions and processes which shape our existence.
        Perhaps we might even distill patterns and lessons to guide – but never to determine – our responses to the
        challenges faced today. History is the study of people, actions, decisions, interactions and behaviours. It is
        so compelling a subject because it encapsulates themes which expose the human condition in all of its guises and
        that resonate throughout time: power, weakness, corruption, tragedy, triumph … Nowhere are these themes clearer
        than in political history, still the necessary core of the field and the most meaningful of the myriad
        approaches to the study of history. Yet political history has fallen out of fashion and subsequently into
        disrepute, wrongly demonised as stale and irrelevant. The result has been to significantly erode the utility of
        ordering, explaining and distilling lessons from the <a href target="blank">read more</a></p>>

    History’s primary purpose is to stand at the centre of diverse, tolerant, intellectually rigorous debate about
    our existence: our political systems, leadership, society, economy and culture. However, open and free debate –
    as in so many areas of life – is too often lacking and it is not difficult to locate the cause of this
    intolerance.

    Writing history can be a powerful tool; it has shaped identities, particularly at the national level. Moreover,
    it grants those who control the narrative the ability to legitimise or discredit actions, events and individuals
    in the present. Yet to marshal history and send it into battle merely to serve the needs of the present is
    misuse and abuse. History should never be a weapon at the heart of culture wars. Sadly, once again, it is:
    clumsily wielded by those who deliberately seek to impose a clear ideological agenda. History is becoming the
    handmaiden of identity politics and self-flagellation. This only promotes poor, one-dimensional understandings
    of the past and continually diminishes the utility of the field. History stands at a crossroads; it must refuse
    to follow the trend of the times.</p>
